This project was Developed alongside Mads, Benajmin and Lasse.

My role in this project was as a creative lead and developer.

The project is a prototype Tower Defense game, in virtual reality.

A Tower Defense game is characterized by a game, wherein the player defends an object, usually a castle of some sort, against waves
of enemies that storm the castle. The player defends the castle by building structures that fire at the enemies. The enemies get stronger
and so the towers must be upgraded in order to maintain the defense.

I developed the code alongside Benjamin and later Mads, who made sweeping changes to the first iteration.
Mads and Benjamin were a step ahead of me and as such they have the credit for the code structure.

The demands for this project was simply that we implented an IT system, and we decided that we would like to develop a game.
It just so happend that our university had bought equipment to develop in VR that noone was using and so we took up the challange.

The idea was to create a Tower Defense game that dindt just send waves against the player, but would actively collect information on the 
players Towers and then alter the type of enemies that would storm the castle. 

Therefore we had different enemies and towers, with different resistances and damages, and different types of enemies who could collect
information and others who would just attack the base.
